                <div class="review">I Want To Eat Your Pancreas, a realistic movie about Living with Dying.</br> The anime film is directed and written by Shin’ichirō Ushijima and distributed by Aniplex. Based on the novel by Yoru Sumino, the story revolves around two high school students Sakura, and her new friend, whose name only gets revealed towards the end of the story. This is an important layer in the story, as his name only strengthens the idea of fate. The fate that brought them together. Overall the movie toys quite a bit around with foreshadowing certain circumstances in very subtle ways</div>
